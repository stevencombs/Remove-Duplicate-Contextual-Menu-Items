Remove-Duplicate-Contextual-Menu-Items
======================================

This repository contains a shell script (*rdcmi.command*), an Alfred 2 Workflow (*Remove Duplicate Contextual Menu Items.alfredworkflow*) and an Alfred 1 Extension (*Remove Duplicate Contextual Menu Items.alfredextension*) to clean up those pesky duplicate contextual menu items that appear when you right-click a file as shown in the image below:

* Double-click the *rdcmi.command* to run the shell script
* Double-click the *Remove Duplicate Contextual Menu Items.alfredextension* to install the Alfred Extension

The code found in the shell script is identical to the code found the Alfred workflow/extension. Any update to the shell script will be updated in the Alfred extension to keep them in parity.
